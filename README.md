### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Jeremy Forest](jeremyforest.com)
I'm a bit of a jack of all trade. A neuroscientist by training, turned artificial neural network researcher and engineer, neuromorphics engineer and software developer.
I love exploring new things ! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple projects:
  - [Annolid](https://github.com/jeremyforest/annolid), a computer vision project based on instance segmentation that is able to perform accurate classification of animal behavior.
  - [Sapicore](https://github.com/jeremyforest/sapicore) and Sapinet (closed repo) which are used in my research on olfactory-inspired spiking neural network development. 

- ðŸ”­ One of my personal projects include:
  - Getting my [homelab](https://github.com/jeremyforest/homelab) in a state compatible with Infrastructure-as-Code. Its slow going ;)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Generative-AI to code up an [personal learning assistant](https://github.com/jeremyforest/eduLLM) aimed at helping students learn more efficiently. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on various research projects. 
  - I am looking at how brain-inspired activity rules can help artificial neural network learn more sparsly and efficiently.
  - I want to investigate how similar dendrite computation are to transformers computations and if dendritic-inspired computation can enhance transformer-like networks in spiking nets.    

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! Really :)
